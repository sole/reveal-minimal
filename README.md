# reveal-minimal

This is a first, unfinished, quickly done in a rush because I've got a bunch of deadlines approaching, attempt to minimally build a slide deck using reveal.js but not really using it with grunt or gulp or anything.

Feel free to star this repository if interested on future updates but please don't send requests or file issues: I already know this is really not user-friendly :-)

Instructions and stuff will happen. Just be patient.

## npm scripts

* `build`: build the whole thingie
* `build:scss`: `src/css/main.scss` to `build/css/main.css` - for creating custom Reveal.js themes. `index.jade` should point to the right theme you want to use.
